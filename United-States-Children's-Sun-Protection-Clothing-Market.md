One notable opportunity is the expansion of product lines to cater to a broader range of age groups.

As children become more involved in outdoor activities, the demand for specialized sun protection clothing for different age brackets is expected to rise. This offers a lucrative opportunity for brands to diversify their product offerings and capture a larger share of the market.</p><p>Additionally, the rise of digital marketing and social media platforms offers companies a unique opportunity to directly engage with their target audience.
